# Personalized-Recommendation-System-for-E-Commerce

### Project Overview
A personalized recommendation system is crucial for enhancing user experience in e-commerce platforms by suggesting products based on user preferences and behavior. This project involves building a recommendation system that leverages collaborative filtering and content-based methods to recommend products tailored to individual users.

### Project Goals
###### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather user interaction data (e.g., clicks, ratings) and product metadata.
###### Feature Engineering: Create features from the data to be used in the recommendation model.
###### Model Development: Build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering (Matrix Factorization) and content-based methods.
###### Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
###### Deployment: Develop a web application to serve recommendations to users.

### Steps for Implementation
##### 1. Data Collection
    Use publicly available datasets like:

      MovieLens: Contains user ratings for movies (for collaborative filtering).
      Amazon Product Data: Contains user reviews and product metadata (for content-based recommendations).
##### 2. Data Preprocessing
    Normalization: Normalize numerical features.
    Encoding: Encode categorical features.
    Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
##### 3. Feature Engineering
Extract features related to users and products:

    User Features: Past interactions, preferences.
    Product Features: Metadata such as category, price, and description.
##### 4. Model Development
Implement both collaborative filtering (e.g., Matrix Factorization) and content-based recommendation methods.

##### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the recommendation quality using metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, and Mean Average Precision (MAP).

##### 6. Deployment
Deploy the recommendation system using Flask and integrate it with a simple frontend.
